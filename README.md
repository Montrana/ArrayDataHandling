# ArrayDataHandling
This is assignment 1 from CS-303 at UMKC

This project allows you to upload an array from a file and change that array.
The ways you can alter the array are as follows:
1. Search through the array to see if there is a specific value - if the value is found it will return the location that it is found at. If not found it will tell you that it wasn't found
2. Replace a number in the array - given a valid index, you can replace that index with a value of your choosing
3. Append a number to the end of the array - adds a number inputted from the user to the end of the array
4. Delete a number from the array - gets input from the user for the index and deletes that index

There is also an option to print the array as it currently is.

All examples of the inputs and outputs have been provided in the repository under Folder Input-Output Examples
